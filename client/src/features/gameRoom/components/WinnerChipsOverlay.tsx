/**
 * Sweep the chips that are currently sitting in the bank pile onto the
 * winner's seat. We don't render any chips of our own — we collect the
 * *actual* on-table chips (rendered by `AnteOverlay` + `BetOverlay`,
 * tagged with `data-table-chip`) and run a new WAAPI animation on each
 * so the player watches the same chips fly to the winner.
 *
 * The motion is a tight cluster (all chips leave within a fixed
 * ~200 ms window) with a slow per-chip flight so the whole bank
 * arrives together but the actual travel time is long enough to read
 * as a deliberate payout, not a flash. Each chip follows a gentle bow
 * at the midpoint instead of a flat slide.
 *
 * Important:
 *   - `.chip` has `opacity: 0` in CSS. The resting animation kept the chip
 *     visible via `fill: 'forwards'`; once we cancel that, the chip would
 *     snap back to CSS opacity 0 and disappear for a frame. We pin inline
 *     `opacity` and `transform` BEFORE cancelling so the visual state
 *     doesn't lapse, and we use `fill: 'both'` on the new animation so the
 *     first keyframe (`opacity: 1`) is applied during the per-chip delay.
 *   - We lift each chip's parent `.layer` (`data-table-chip-layer`) above
 *     the seat stacking context (z-index 10) so the chips travel *over*
 *     the cards during the sweep.
 *   - The animation uses `fill: 'both'` and fades each chip out in its
 *     final ~22 % so the swept chips disappear into the winner's
 *     nameplate instead of piling up there. Previously they remained at
 *     full opacity until the next round reset the chip layers, which
 *     read as a leftover red dot blinking on the player's name plate.
