// Realtime slice: shape of the server-driven game state. Today the GameRoom

// (see `src/websocket/storeBridge.ts`) will call these `apply*` actions in
// response to `WS_EVENTS.ROOM_STATE`, `GAME_TICK`, etc. The reducers stay
// pure so they can be unit-tested without React.
//
// Reconciliation rules:
//   - `applySnapshot` accepts only versions ≥ the current one. Older
//     snapshots are dropped (`desyncCount` is bumped) so a stale
//     `room:state` reply can never overwrite fresher local state.
//   - `applyTick` requires `tick.version == state.version` and
//     `tick.t > state.lastTickT`. Anything else is treated as stale.
//   - When a tick is dropped because of a *version mismatch* (gap or
//     reset), the bridge is expected to call `wsClient.send(REQUEST_SNAPSHOT)`
//     to resync. The slice itself doesn't talk to the wire.
