/**
 * Adapter between svarapro's `GameState` and the v143 client store.
 *
 * The svarapro NestJS server pushes `GameState` snapshots on
 * `game_state` (initial, single-recipient) and `game_update` (broadcast
 * to the room). v143's `gameStore` reads the simpler `RoomSnapshot`
 * shape from `shared/protocol`. This module is the only place the two
 * shapes meet — keep all the field-by-field mapping here so the rest of
 * the app stays protocol-agnostic.
 *
 * Mapping notes:
 *   - svarapro seats players by `position` (0..maxPlayers-1). v143
 *     keys its `SeatMap` by `SeatId` (string), so we stringify the
 *     position. `SeatId` is just a wire string in the schema.
 *   - svarapro's `status` is a richer enum (`ante`, `blind_betting`,
 *     `svara`, ...) than v143's `phase`. Map them to the closest v143
 *     phase so the existing reducer keeps working; the granular status
 *     is preserved on the player object for components that need it.
 *   - The receiving player's `hand` is included as long as the client
 *     filters its own seat (the server sends face-down cards for
 *     others). We forward `cards` as-is; the caller decides which seat
 *     is "me".
